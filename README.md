# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Standup-Comedians
Finding the best standup comedian, and what made him/her the best standup comedian

I Gathered this data by web scrapping from The Scrap from the loft website. I collected the list of best comedians on netflix from Imdb rating site. Later I scrapped the transcripts of the data. In the data claning stage I converted the text into lowercase and removed all the punctuations, semicolons, etc., 

In the Exploratory Data analysis stage I pulled the insights from the data, like the most common words used by all the comedians. Later I plotted the wordcloud using Python libraries.

For sentimental analysis I found both the polarity and subjectivity of each comedian and plotted the analysis using matplotlib library in python.
